To test/run this project and see the full functionalities kindly follow these steps:
1- run main.m file that decodes the test text file using Huffman encoding.
2- run Conv_encoder.m to apply encoder.
3- run ViterbiDec.m to apply decoder and disp the figure.
4- run main.m again to recover the output (Viterbi decoded message) using Huffman again and see End-to-End project
